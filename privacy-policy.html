    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using our Smart Mirror. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our service.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect health-related data, including heart rate, steps, and other relevant information, from connected devices such as the Apple Watch or Garmin. This data is used to display on your smart mirror for personal health monitoring purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used exclusively for displaying health metrics like heart rate on the Smart Mirror interface. We do not share or sell your data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not store your personal health data. The data is collected and displayed in real-time on your device without being stored long-term. Once the session ends, the data is not retained.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to ensure the security of your data while it is being transferred between your device and our system. However, we cannot guarantee complete security, as no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete the data that you provide through your device. Since we do not store this data long-term, once the session ends, your data is no longer accessible.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at [Insert Email Address].</p>
